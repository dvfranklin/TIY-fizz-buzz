# Fizzbuzz

After completing the original Fizzbuzz assignment, I went ahead and completed the "Beast Mode" version by converting my iterator to the Integer class, then to a String. I added a contains("3") and contains("5") method to the original conditions.

Since some numbers would meet both conditions, e.g. 35 & 53, I decided that those numbers would be assigned "Fizzbuzz" rather than either "Fizz" or "Buzz."
